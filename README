This is a Javascript Google Maps extension for the GPolygon class to detect whether or not a point resides within it. Included is a sample HTML page that makes use of it to demonstrate usage.

Simplest Usage:

var coordinate = new GLatLng(40, -90);
var polygon = new GPolygon([], "#000000", 1, 1, "#336699", 0.3);
var isWithinPolygon = polygon.containsLatLng(coordinate);
